# Preload your desired wallpapers into memory.
# Replace the paths with your actual wallpaper paths.
preload = ~/Pictures/pawel-czerwinski-UKSC-TQE7TA-unsplash.jpg

# Set the wallpaper for your monitor(s).
# You can get your monitor name using `hyprctl monitors`.
# For example, if your monitor is named "eDP-1":
wallpaper = ,~/Pictures/pawel-czerwinski-UKSC-TQE7TA-unsplash.jpg

# To set the same wallpaper on all monitors without specifying each one:
# wallpaper = ,~/Pictures/wallpapers/my_awesome_wallpaper.png

# You can also use different modes (cover, contain, tile). Default is cover.
# wallpaper = eDP-1,contain:~/Pictures/wallpapers/my_awesome_wallpaper.png

# Enable IPC (Inter-Process Communication) if you want to control hyprpaper
# with `hyprctl hyprpaper` commands later (e.g., to change wallpapers on the fly).
ipc = true

# Optional: Enable the Hyprland splash text rendering over the wallpaper.
# splash = true
